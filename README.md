# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
This application requires a MongoDB database, configured by setting a
`MONGO_URI` environment variable. By default, the [config file](./src/config.ts)
sets the MongoDB URI to `mongodb://localhost:27017/test`.

Additionally, this application requires two JWT secret keys, configured by
setting a `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` 
environment variable. For development and testing, the following can be used:
```sh
export JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='super-secret-key-1'
export JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET='super-secret-key-2'
```
